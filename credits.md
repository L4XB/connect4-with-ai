### Game Board

 ○ Lecture Slides + Colab examples

 ○ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkmYfTl2L_Y
    -> I got my gameboard design from there, but I didn't copy anything and 
       implemented and optimised everything myself

### Inspiration

 ○ https://github.com/ForrestKnight/ConnectFour/blob/master/AIClass.py
    -> Check how others display the board and organize theri code (but copyed nothing from this)

 ○ https://github.com/erikackermann/Connect-Four/blob/master/minimax.py
    -> Check how others implemet the mixmax (but copyed nothing from this)


### Evaluation
