### General Stuff

 ○ https://realpython.com/python-comments-guide/
    -> used to get best practices at python comments

 ○ https://www.appacademy.io/blog/python-coding-best-practices
    -> python best practices

 ○ https://realpython.com/tutorials/best-practices/
    -> much stuff from here to understand some python functionallities


### Game Board

 ○ Lecture Slides + Colab examples

 ○ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkmYfTl2L_Y
    -> I got my gameboard design from there, but I didn't copy anything and implemented and optimised everything myself

### Smart Agent

 ○ Lecture Slides + Colab examples

 ○ https://realpython.com/tutorials/best-practices/
    -> got some python functionallities from here

### Inspiration

 ○ https://github.com/ForrestKnight/ConnectFour/blob/master/AIClass.py
    -> Check how others display the board and organize theri code (copyed nothing from this)

 ○ https://github.com/erikackermann/Connect-Four/blob/master/minimax.py
    -> Check how others implemet the mixmax their code (copyed nothing from this)

### Evaluation

 ○ https://pypi.org/project/psutil/
    -> To read Memory usage

### Evaluation Graphics

 ○ https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html
    -> Got the most informations how to use matplotlib from here

 ○ https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_bars.asp
    -> Got some informations how to combine graphics from here
